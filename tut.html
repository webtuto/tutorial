      For writing the codes in html, I preffer using "VS CODE". It has many benefits, you will be helped a lot while using this editor.
      There are many short-cuts and emmets, which will help you write the code and will comparitively take less time for writing the code. 
      If you use any other editors you will have to write the boiler-plate code too. But this editor has made this thing easy, you just have to press 
      "Shift + !" then press "Enter" and boom! the code is ready. There are so many similar short cuts like this.
