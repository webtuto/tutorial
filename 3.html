    <p class="para">
       For learing how to make a website, all you need a laptop, your time, patience, and lots of exitement.
       At first you have to start with HTML. If you dont have any knowledge about HTML then you first have to learn this and then you can jump into css.
       I would recommend you to start html, many people want to learn evrything in one go and end up messing things. So i dont want you guys to get 
       confused and lose interest. Anyway then we have gone through enough of the introductory part, it time to start our course.
