        Hey! Everyone, I hope you took a glance of my tutorials and I am assuming you liked it. It was also a litle challenging for me aswell at the 
        beginning when i was learning to make a website. I did a lot of surfing on the internet for some knowledge. Though some sites used to provide
        all the basic things i needed but at the same time some problems used to arise. After I have gained some of the points a beginner might face,
        therefore i have tried my best to solve all the queries of my fellow mates and anyone who is here reading this now. i will not be going in-depth
        of all the things but of-course you will be having all the things one needs to make a website. After you have done learning all the basic steps
        you can build other styling techniques and if you like desining you can of-course do better than me. HTML and CSS is what I have taught you,
        Infact this website is also made with HTML and CSS. You can also use JAVASCRIPT with the formers if you need. I haven't used JAVASCRIPT here
        neither i have taught here. If you want to learn JAVASCRIPT then you can reffer other online resources available. I just tried to keep this tutorials
        as simple as possible so that all my beginner friends can learn without mixing all and getting confused. Anyway then if you have come far 
        then Thank You so much and if you haven't checked my tutorial then do give it a look and if you have checked already then thank you again!
        Have a Good Day!
